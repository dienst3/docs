## Introduction

The public Dienst 3 API is accessible through REST http requests.
We encourage you to create amazing applications which integrate with Dienst.
We have created these documentation pages in order to provide you with the tools you need for this.
If you prefer to do code generation or use an API platform you can download our [OpenAPI files](https://github.com/dienst3/docs/blob/main/openapi.yaml).

## Authentication

We support a few different methods to authenticate your requests.
All have their use case, so make sure to read the next section carefully so you can find out which method is applicable to you.

All tokens are Bearer authentication tokens, meaning you have to specify them in the `Authorization` header of your request like so:

```bash
'Authorization': 'Bearer <access_token>'
```

### OpenID Connect

<Warning>This method is not yet available.</Warning>

[OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/) is an industry standard for authorization of third party applications.
You can utilize this framework with your favorite framework to get authorization for your application in minutes.
Consult the documentation of your framework to see how to implement this.
With <Tooltip tip="OpenID Connect">OIDC</Tooltip> you can fetch data and make calls on behalf of your members in a safe way.

Within Dienst 3 OIDC clients are scoped to the association they belong to.
If you want to use authorization with multiple associations, you'll have to create a client for every one independently.

OIDC is of course a superset of [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/), so if you don't need authentication you can disregard the OIDC layer.

### Association Access Tokens

<Warning>This method is not yet available.</Warning>

Sometimes you just need to talk to our API to get some data or make changes to your association in a simple way.
This is for example done in one-of scripts for generating reports or a tool which isn't available natively in Dienst 3.

### Personal Access Tokens

<Warning>This method is not yet available.</Warning>

Association access tokens are very useful tools, but are scoped to one entire association.
These can also only be created by administrators of an association, but you would still want to interact.
This is what the <Tooltip tip="Personal Access Token">PAT</Tooltip> is made for.
You can create this for your personal account, and is not limited to one assocation.
With the PAT you can make all requests you can also do with the normal user interface, as it inherits the permissions of your account.
